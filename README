This is my .vim/ there are many like it but this is mine.

Mainly here for backup purposes but feel free to borrow anything, I know I've borrowed from others to create it.

To install:

    git clone https://github.com/flynnguy/dotvim.git ~/.vim/
    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

Then Launch vim and run

    :PluginInstall

Then to finish the YouCompleteMe install:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
    ./install.sh --clang-completer
