This is my .vim/ there are many like it but this is mine.

Mainly here for backup purposes but feel free to borrow anything, I know I've borrowed from others to create it.

To install:
git clone git@github.com:flynnguy/dotvim.git ~/.vim/
cd ~/.vim/
git submodule update --init
cd ~/.vim/bundle/command-t/
rake make
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
